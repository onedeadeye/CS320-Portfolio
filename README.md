## How can you ensure that your code, program or software is functional and secure?
- In the modern software development lifecycle, regular software testing is the mechanism intended to enforce software performance, security and functionality. Functional and non-functional testing are both key subdivisions of this task, empowered by automated testing suites like JUnit for powerful regression and integration testing with minimal developer upkeep. 

## How do you interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- User needs are the guiding north star for any software project. Needs inform every decision, trivial and scope-defining, and so require the highest accuracy in interpretation and cataloging. This process can necessitate further meetings, digital and physical discussions as well as product reviews to ensure the developer and client's vision for the software are consistently aligned. 

## How do you approach designing software?
- After the foundation of user needs is set, the functional design of software depends on the use case. Most modern software packages are designed to be object-oriented, using class inheritance and composition to cut down on redundany and produce cleaner code that is simpler to test and secure. Often times, beyond the core architectural design, user needs will prove invaluable in determining the more precise details of software design, such as helping to identify what classes will be interacted with the most, and as such are better candidates for housing core program logic.
